# Task5

We used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize the Titanic dataset. Through bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps, we explored survival patterns across different features such as gender, age, passenger class, and port of embarkation, uncovering key insights about who was more likely to survive.
